        Oh my heart is cryin' in the night for you <br>
        Oh my God oh don't you feel like a fool <br>
        You're foolin' yourself with a millionaire <br>
        You think it's love but he don't care <br>
        And one of these days you're gonna be surprised <br> <br>

        Diamonds never made a lady <br>
        Lover or a friend I know it <br>
        Diamonds never made a lady <br>
        Oh your dreams will end I know it <br> <br>

        Your California nights <br>
        Oh money held you tight <br>
        It was just a dream <br>
        Come on don't tell me lies <br>
        Give me the peaceful nights <br>
        Your sweet dreams <br> <br>

        Oh my God you really think you have it made <br>
        Your heart is one with first-class expensive paint <br>
        You drink champagne eat caviar <br>
        A color-tv in a back of your car <br>
        But one of these days you're gonna be surprised <br> <br>
    </h2>
