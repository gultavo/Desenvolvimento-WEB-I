        <br>
        Like the leaves fallin' off a tree <br>
        I feel your love is dyin' for me <br>
        Ooh you tell me it's not the end <br>
        Where is the love that you're for sent <br> <br>

        There's too much blue in missing you <br>
        I believe I was a fool <br>
        Before you said goodbye <br>
        Oh give us one more try <br>
        Yeah I can't forget <br>
        All the love we had <br> <br>

        There's too much blue in missing you <br>
        Oh believe my heart is true <br>
        Your love's slippin' away <br>
        A little bit everyday <br>
        Throwin' away <br>
        In such an easy way <br> <br>

        Look at me I'm lucky one <br>
        Without feelings you can't be strong <br>
        Thou I call you in the night <br>
        To hear your voice feel you deep inside <br> <br>
    </h2>
