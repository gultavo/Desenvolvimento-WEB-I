        <br>
        You packed your things in a carpetbag <br>
        Left and never looking back <br>
        Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes <br>
        Music where ever you go <br>
        You don't fit in a small town world <br>
        But I feel you're the girl for me <br>
        Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes <br>
        You're leaving town where nobody knows <br> <br>
        You can win if you want <br>
        If you want it, you will win <br>
        On your way, you will see that life is more than fantasy <br>
        Take my hand, follow me <br>
        Oh, you've got a brand-new friend for your life <br> <br>
        You can win if you want <br>
        If you want it, you will win <br>
        Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand-new wild romance <br>
        Take my hand for the night <br>
        And your feelings will be right, hold me tight <br> <br>
        Oh, darkness finds you on your own <br>
        Endless highways keep on rolling on <br>
        You're miles and miles from your home <br>
        But you never want to phone your home <br>
        A steady job and a nice young man <br>
        Your parents had your future planned <br>
        Rings on your finger, paint on your toes <br>
        That's the way your story goes <br> <br>
        You can win if you want <br>
        If you want it, you will win <br>
        On your way, you will see that life is more than fantasy <br>
        Take my hand, follow me <br>
        Oh, you've got a brand-new friend for your life <br> <br>
        You can win if you want <br>
        If you want it, you will win <br>
        Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand-new wild romance <br>
        Take my hand for the night <br>
        And your feelings will be right, hold me tight <br> <br>
        You can win if you want <br>
        If you want it, you will win <br>
        Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand-new wild romance <br>
        Take my hand for the night <br>
        And your feelings will be right, hold me tight <br> <br>
